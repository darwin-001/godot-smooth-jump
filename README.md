# Godot Platformer: Variable Jump System

This Godot project provides a clear and robust implementation of a **Variable Jump** system for your platformer games. Give your players precise control over their jumps, making the gameplay feel more dynamic and rewarding!

---

## Project Description

This repository contains the example Godot Engine project for implementing a **Variable Jump System** in a 2D platformer. This technique allows for different jump heights based on player input duration, enhancing responsiveness and player control.

---

## What's Inside?

* **Dynamic Jump Heights:** Learn how to make your character jump higher or lower based on how long the jump button is held. A quick tap for small hops, a longer press for soaring leaps!
* **Intuitive Player Control:** This system significantly enhances player agency, allowing for more skillful navigation through your **platformer levels**.
* **Smooth Jump Curves:** Example code demonstrating how to achieve natural-looking jump arcs, not just sudden changes in velocity.

---

## Why Use This?

Implementing a variable jump system will:

* Elevate your **platformer's** game feel and responsiveness.
* Allow for more intricate level design that leverages different jump heights.
* Provide players with a satisfying sense of control over their character's movement.
* Make your **Godot platformer** stand out with polished mechanics.
